## EMERGENCE AND ARTIFICIAL LIFE


This project (“Evolving soft locomotion in aquatic and terrestrial environments: effects of material properties and environmental transitions”) was created by F. Corucci, N. Cheney, F. Giorgio-Serchi, J. Bongard, and C. Laschi.
    
The project demonstrates emergence in the sense that each of the “lifeforms” was designed by programmers with only a handful of basic principles, but through the process of placing them into an environment which affects their ability to move, they evolve, just like real life animals, and depending on the environment, different possibilities emerge (i.e. in =aquatic-like environments they move more freely, and in land-like environments, they move with more solid structure). 
   
My own understanding of emergence is that it is something that happens not necessarily based upon the principles of an object’s being (or person/animal/etc.), but rather upon the way the object interacts with, and is affected by its surroundings. Because of this, you can have 100 exact copies of the same “being”, but depending on the way each being reacts to its environment, they may behave entirely differently. For example, Identical twins are biologically two “copies” of the same person, as they share the same DNA, however, due to the consequences of their environment, each of the two twins will grow up to be very different from each other. They’ll have different personalities, dress different, talk different, walk different, etc. Code can work in the same way, as it is essentially the computer equivalent of DNA, and if two programmed objects share identical code, but are each differently affected by their environment, they won’t behave the same way.

For this project, I made an array of creatures which "react" to a bear. If they are far away from the bear, they're green, but as they get approach the bear, they shift from green, to yellow, to orange, and then finally to red. If they are too close, the bear will eat them and they will be dead. To protect them, when they are very close to the bear, their movement speed is increased, and they can either quickly scurry away from the bear, or instead scurry straight into it's mouth. When the bear eats all of the creatures, the program ends.
